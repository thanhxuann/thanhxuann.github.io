<p>Hey this is my portion of the our teams page and I will leave some
    information for my teammates can get to know me a bit more based on
    my favorite hobby, which is gaming. But gaming refers to so many
    different genres that people can not really get an understanding from
    simply that message. So what I decided to do is make a table to show
    some of the genres of games I enjoy and the game I most enjoy in each
    genre.
</p>

<h4>Game Table</h4>

<table style="width:50%">
<tr>
    <th><span style="color:cadetblue">Genre</span></th>
    <th><span style="color:cadetblue">Favorite Game</span></th>
</tr>

<!--Mark's Comment: technically, th is used for the first row or for items in the first column where you're labeling that column's or row's category. After that, you should switch to td for normal table cells. This means that all of the th tags below this comment in this table should be td.-->
<tr>
    <th>JRPG</th>
    <th>The World Ends With You</th>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>Action Adenture</th>
    <th>Yakuza 0</th>

<p>In addition to enjoying video games I have been able to transfer my passion for
    it, and contribut to the Husky Game Club here on campus from the very start of
    my time here at UWB in 2019. As of now I am the club president and wish to keep
    on helping the club be a community for anyone that enjoys games regardless of
    genre interest. So there are a few things I am happy with, but still have things
    I wish to develop in the club.
</p>

<div><strong>Things I am happy with:</strong></div>

<ul>
    <li>Club sturcture</li>
    <li>Members of the club</li>
    <li>Weekly events with other clubs</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Things I wish to improve based on priority:</strong></div>
<ol>
    <li>Have a way for people with interests in single player games to express themselves</li>
    <li>Have collaborations with other clubs, due to the BWiSE collaborations being fun to be a part of.</li>
    <li>For when in person classes come back have balance of in person and remote events for people to partcipate in.</li>
</ol>

  <br>I recently got a new car. Literally bought it Monday morning and am picking it up this Saturday</br>
  <br>Its the Scion FRS</br>
  <br>Its a pretty nice car. It's black, low milage, but the best part is that it is my dream car.</br>
  <br>I'm pretty proud of myself because not only is it my dream car, but I'm also paying for it myself.</br>
  <br>The picture below is how the front looks. Not the greatest picture, but there will be better picture after I pick it up this Saturday</br>
